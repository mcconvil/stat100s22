### Bootstrapped Confidence Intervals


**SE Method 95% CI**:

$$
\mbox{statistic} \pm 2\widehat{\mbox{SE}}
$$

We approximate $\mbox{SE}$ with $\widehat{\mbox{SE}}$ = the standard deviation of the bootstrapped statistics.


**Percentile Method CI:**

If I want a P% confidence interval, I find the bounds of the middle P% of the bootstrap distribution.


Assuming random sample and roughly bell-shaped and symmetric bootstrap distribution for both methods.

### What do we mean by confidence?



CI: Interval of **plausible values** for the **parameter**



I am P% confident that the true parameter is in the computed interval.

##  Notes on CIs

CI = interval of **plausible** values for the **parameter**


--

* Confidence level = success rate of the method under **repeated sampling**

--

* How do I know if my ONE CI successfully contains the true value of the parameter?

--

* As we increase the **confidence level**, what happens to the width of the interval?

--

* As we increase the **sample size**, what happens to the width of the interval?

--

* As we increase the **number of bootstrap samples** we take, what happens to the width of the interval?

## Example: Does Extrasensory Perception (ESP) exist?

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.cap = "Daryl Bem and Ben Honorton"}

```

.pull-right[

Bem and Honorton conducted extrasensory perception  studies:



* A "sender" randomly chooses an object out of 4 possible objects and sends that information to a "receiver".
* The "receiver" is then given a set of 4 possible objects and they must decide which one most resembles the object sent to them.

Out of 329 trials, the "receivers" correctly identified the object 106 times.

]

---

## ESP Example

Let's consider the following questions:

--

a. If ESP does not exist and the "receivers" are guessing, how often would we expect them to be correct?

--

&rarr; <span style="color: orange;">25% of the time</span>

--

b. For each sample (set of 329 trials), do we expect the proportion of correct guesses to be equal?  Why or why not?

--

&rarr; <span style="color: orange;">No because of sampling variability!</span>

--

c. Is it possible to randomly guess correctly 106 out of 329 times (i.e., 32% of the time)?

--

&rarr; <span style="color: orange;">Yes but plausible?</span>

--

d. How unusual is it to guess correctly 106 out of 329 times if ESP doesn't exist?

--

To help us answer d., we need a **sampling distribution** for the sample proportion where **we assume the "receivers" were purely guessing!**

## Sampling Distribution of a Statistic

.pull-left[

**Steps for (Approximate) Distribution:**

(1) Decide on a sample size, $n$.

(2) Randomly select a sample of size $n$ from the population.

(3) Compute the sample statistic.

(4)  Put the sample back in.

(5) Repeat Steps (2) - (4) many (1000+) times.

## Sampling Distribution Under No ESP



**Steps for (Approximate) Distribution:**


--

(1) Decide on a sample size, $n$. 


--


&rarr; <span style="color: orange;">n = 329.</span> 


--

(2) Randomly select a sample of size $n$ from the population. 


--

&rarr; <span style="color: orange;"> 
We can generate one draw from this population by flipping an unfair coin where the probability of heads (i.e., a correct answer) is 0.25. </span>

--

&rarr; <span style="color: orange;"> For the sample, flip the coin 329 times. </span>

--

```{r}
library(mosaic)
rflip(n = 329, prob = 0.25)
```


---


## Sampling Distribution Under No ESP


(3) Compute the sample statistic.


--

&rarr; <span style="color: orange;"> Compute the proportion of heads (i.e., correct answers). </span>

--

```{r}
rflip(n = 329, prob = 0.25, summarize = TRUE)
```


--

(4)  Put the sample back in.


(5) Repeat Steps (2) - (4) many (1000+) times.

--


```{r}
guess_sampling_dist <- do(1000)*rflip(n = 329, prob = 0.25)
guess_sampling_dist
```

## Sampling Distribution Under No ESP

       mapping = aes(x = prop)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white",

```

* What value should our sampling distribution be centered around if the receivers are just guessing?

In pairs:

* Decide who is going to be the sender and who is going to be the receiver.

* **Sender:** Think of one of these images.

* **Receiver:** Guess which image the sender was thinking of.  

* Now switch roles and do it again!  

* Once you have both played each role, each person should add a tally mark on the chalkboard.

## Do Harvardians Have ESP?

What do we need to modify in the code to answer the question?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
guess_sampling_dist <- do(1000)*rflip(n = 329, prob = 0.25)
p_hat <- 106/329
ggplot(data = guess_sampling_dist, mapping = aes(x = prop)) +
