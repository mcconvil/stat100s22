.pull-right[

* You are **expected** to attend lectures and sections.
    + But I recognize that with COVID and other excused reasons, there will be absences.  Just make sure to **communicate** with your TF and me.



* We will use [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/343471) for submitting work.
    + More on that in your first section meeting.



* I will introduce you to our Rstudio Server during a Week 1 lecture.



* The primary textbook, [Modern Dive](https://moderndive.com/), and the supplemental textbook, [Introduction to Modern Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/book/ims/), are both free online.

## Identity and the Classroom

* Acknowledge that my perspectives and experiences have shaped how I teach this course

--

* Some of my identities place me in dominant groups while others in marginalized groups


--


* Strive to bring examples and scholarly contributions that value knowledge from folks with a wide variety of identities


--

* Strive to be a open listener and recognize your thoughts as a generous offer and a vote of confidence in my ability to hear and be transformed by you

--

* Ask that you reflect on your own identities, privileges, and power and how they impact your engagement with Stat 100

## Code of Conduct

I expect all members of STAT 100 to make participation a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.  

I expect everyone to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming diverse, inclusive, and healthy community of learners.  You can contribute to a positive learning environment by demonstrating empathy and kindness, being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences, and giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.


This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html), version 2.0.
