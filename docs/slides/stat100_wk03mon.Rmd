## Goals for Today

.pull-left[

* Measures for **summarizing** quantitative data
    + Center
    + Spread/variability

* Measures for **summarizing** categorical data


] 

--

.pull-right[


* Start discussing **data wrangling**

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width= "15%", out.extra='style="float:left; padding:10px"'}

## Load Necessary Packages

`dplyr` is part of this collection of data science packages.

```{r, message=TRUE}
# Load necessary packages
library(tidyverse)
```


---

## Import the [Data](https://data.cambridgema.gov/Transportation-Planning/Eco-Totem-Broadway-Bicycle-Count/q8v9-mcfg)

```{r, cache = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
bike_counter <- read_csv("https://data.cambridgema.gov/api/views/q8v9-mcfg/rows.csv")

# Inspect the data
glimpse(bike_counter)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
bike_counter <- select(bike_counter, -DateTime,
                       -Westbound, -Eastbound, -Day)
```

## Summarizing Data

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
knitr::kable(bike_counter[1000:1006,]) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("responsive", "bordered", "striped")) 
```

* Hard to do by eyeballing a spreadsheet with many rows!

##  Summarizing Data Visually

.pull-left[

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Create histogram
ggplot(data = bike_counter, mapping = aes(x = Total)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "slateblue4", color = "ghostwhite")

For a quantitative variable, want to answer:



* What is an **average** value?



* What is the **trend/shape** of the variable?



* How much **variation** is there from case to case?

## Summarizing Quantitative Variables

For a quantitative variable, want to answer:



* What is an average value?



* What is the trend/shape of the variable?


* How much variation is there from case to case?

--

Need to learn some **summary statistics**: Numerical values computed based on the observed cases.

---

## Measures of Center

.pull-left[
**Mean: average of all the observations**


* $n$ = Number of cases (sample size)
* $x_i$ = value of the i-th observation
* Denote by $\bar{x}$

$$
\bar{x}  = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i
$$

## Measures of Variability

* Want a statistic that captures how much observations will likely deviate from the mean

.pull-left[

Here is my proposal:

* Find how much each observation deviates from the mean.

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})
$$

## Measures of Variability

* In addition to the sample standard deviation and the sample variance, there is the Interquartile Range (IQR): 

$$
\mbox{IQR} = \mbox{Q}_3 - \mbox{Q}_1
$$

* Which is more robust to outliers, the IQR or $s$?

* Which is more commonly used, the IQR or $s$?

### Data Wrangling: Transformations done on the data

--

**Why wrangle the data?**

--

.pull-left[

To **summarize** the data.

]


.pull-right[

&#8594; To compute the mean and standard deviation of the bike counts.

]

--

.pull-left[

To **drop** missing values.  (Need to be careful here!)

]

.pull-right[

&#8594; In your P-Set 2, you are dropping rows with NAs for particular variables before creating some of your graphs.

]


--

.pull-left[

To **filter** to a particular subset of the data.

]

.pull-right[

&#8594; To subset the bike counts data to 2 days in July of 2019.

]

--

.pull-left[

To **collapse** the categories of a categorical variable.



]

.pull-right[

&#8594; To go from 86 dog breeds to just mixed or single breed.

]


--

.pull-left[

To **arrange** the data to make it easier to display.

]

.pull-right[

&#8594; To sort from most common dog name to least common.

]

--

.pull-left[

To fix how `R` **stores** a variable.

]

.pull-right[

&#8594; I converted `Day` from a character variable/vector to a date variable/vector.
