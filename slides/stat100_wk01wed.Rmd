## Language: `R`-This, `R`-That, `R`-...

Three `R` Things:

--

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width= "15%", out.extra='style="float:left; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Rlogo.png")
```

<br>

`R` is the name of the programming language.


--

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width= "15%", out.extra='style="float:left; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/RStudio.png")
```

<br>

 `RStudio` is the pretty interface.

<br>

--

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width= "15%", out.extra='style="float:left; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rmarkdown.png")
```

<br>

`RMarkdown` is the type of file where we will record all of our work (code, output, narrative).

<br>

## Let's Get Started with `R`!

## First step: Navigate to the class Canvas site.


---

## Accessing the RStudio Server



```{r  out.width = "95%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/raccess.001.jpeg")
```

* First time may take a while.

## Main Components of RStudio Lay-Out 


```{r  out.width = "85%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/layout.png")
```

### Main Components of RStudio Lay-Out

**Console**

* Sideways carrot called **prompt**.

* Where you run code.

* Let's try it:

```{r}

.pull-left[.fullish-width[.content-box-yellow[

**Environment**

* Lists items stored in your session.

* Will add some items soon!

.pull-left[.fullish-width[.content-box-yellow[

**Files et. al.**

* **Files**: Accesses files in your own directory and the shared directory `shared_data`.

* **Plots**: Contains graphs we create.

* **Packages**: Installs and loads packages.

* **Help**: Displays help files.

]]]


---

##Accessing Course Materials 

* All `R` related course materials will be stored in the `shared_data` folder in the **Files** tab.

* You can access shared files but **you must move the files to your home directory** before you edit and save them.

* Let's practice that now with `introRMarkdown.Rmd` which can be found in `shared_data/stat100/handouts`.

* Steps:
    + Step 1: Click on the `shared_data`, then `stat100`, then `handouts`.
    + Step 2: Click on "introRMarkdown".  It should open in the upper lefthand window.
    + Step 5: Go to the top left of the window and click on File > Save as...
    + Step 6: Click on "Home".
    + Step 7: (Only do this once) Click on **New Folder** and call it "handouts". Hit "Ok".
    + Step 8: Then hit Save.  Now the file is saved in your directory and you are ready to work on it.
