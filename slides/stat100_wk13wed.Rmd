## Review Time!

### Let's first go through the Review Sheet for the Final Exam.

class: middle, center

##  One of the most challenging inferential ideas:

--

###  Understanding the **many roles of the sample statistic**:

--

.pull-left[

As a number

]

--

.pull-right[

As a random variable

]

--

.pull-left[

As a point estimate

]

--

.pull-right[

As a test statistic

]

### Practice Problem

#### Identify the different roles of a statistic in the following example:

Researchers presented young children (aged 5 to 8 years) with a choice between two toy characters who were offering stickers.  One character was described as mean, and the other was described as nice.  The mean character offered two stickers, and the nice character offered one sticker.  Researchers wanted to investigate whether children would tend to select the nice character over the mean character, despite receiving fewer stickers.  


They found that 80% of the 20 children in the study selected the nice character.  If the children had no preference, the probability that 80% or more would select the nice character is approximately equal to 0.0036.  My best guess for the true proportion of children who would select the nice character is 0.8 (with a margin of error of 0.19 for a 95% CI).

### Practice Problem

I generated the following distributions but don't remember if I generated a **sampling**, **bootstrap**, or **null** distribution.


What are each of these?  Justify your answer.

.pull-left[

```{r, echo = FALSE}
dat <- data.frame(selection = c(rep("nice", 16), rep("mean", 4)))

library(infer)
dat %>%
  specify(response = selection, success = "nice") %>%
  hypothesize(null = "point", p = 0.5) %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "draw") %>%
  calculate(stat = "prop") %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

]

#### For this example, would you recommend using theory-based methods to compute the p-value and construct the confidence interval?  Why or why not?

#### Suppose we increased the sample size to 40 and still got 80%.  How would the p-value change?  How about the confidence interval?
